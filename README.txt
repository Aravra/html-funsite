In august 2020 I started this project, I'm from the netherlands and 14 years old, this is my first html site.
I used html,css,php and javascript
with the free webhost i got a database that runs phpmyadmin, i used this in my project

My experience: html was new to me, but it was surprisingly easy to learn. Maybe beceause of my background in c#
